Product Vision:
Hivio is a job application tracking platform that helps college students organize and manage their job search in one centralized system. It solves the problem of disorganized and inefficient job searching by allowing students to track applications, statuses, resumes, notes, and follow-ups in one place . Unlike spreadsheets, notes apps, or job boards, Hivio focuses specifically on tracking and follow-through, providing analytical feedback that helps students understand what strategies are working and improve their chances of success.
